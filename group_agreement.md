## Group Agreement  
  
**Communication plan:**   
Morning stand up/github project board review (at a whiteboard).  
Will communicate using text after-hours (no expectation of response).  
If you work on a feature after hours, text the group.  
When deciding something, we will make sure that there is clear either verbal or non-verbal answers from everyone( yes/no, nod/shake head, thumbs up/down, etc...)  
  
**Conflict plan:**
Low-level disagreements: talk about it as a group, if we cannot agree, we will put it to a vote.  
Larger disagreements: step away for a short break before coming back to the issue, bring in a third party for some outside insight/perspective if needed (teacher, TA, etc...), if absolutely necessary we can flip a coin and move forward.  
If anyone needs to walk away at any time, they can say ‘Ginger’ and walk away for a short break no strings attached.  
  
**Work plan:** 
We will use Github projects for tracking.  
Morning check-in, go through the board, see what has been completed, prioritize what remains, add tasks as needed.   
MVP by end of Tuesday.  
Define MVP as clearly as possible to help manage scope creep.  
Work day is 9-5. If we are falling behind, we can extend the day to 6.  
After hours work is allowed, but there is no expectation of after-hours work.  
  
**Git process:** 
Separate repos for separate deployments.  
Gitflow branch structure.  
No merging after hours.  
  
**Any thing else you feel is important:**  
Code style: Camel Case variables. Snake case filenames.  
Primary and secondary people on each feature, so that there is always more than one person that knows what’s going on.
